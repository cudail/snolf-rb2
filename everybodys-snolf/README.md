A mini-WAD for use with the Snolf character WAD for Sonic Robo Blast 2 that
applies Snolf controls to every character, including those added through other
mods. This is probably going to be quite unstable and you should not assume it
will work nicely with any given character. It's just a bit of fun. Load it in
conjunction with Snolf. The order should not matter.
