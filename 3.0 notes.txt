The code for this mod is a bit of a ungainly mess and could do with a massive overhaul. I don't actually intend to do a full overhaul of it any time soon, but if I get around to it here's some barebones notes for things that should happen:

Use SOC to define actual new states for snolf sitting and charging rather than defining the haviour entirely in LUA by forcing the rolling animation and player flags.

Split things out into more lua files rather than one huge one. Console commands, boss mode and HUD functions in particular could probably be split out easily.

Use rawset(_G) to set custom globals.

Use JumpSpecial hook rather than just reading raw input.

Possibly add the Golf copy ability to any badniks/objects that don't have one that it would be appropriate for.

Investigating using MF_BOUNCE rather than MobjMoveBlocked.

Design with distinction between Snolf, Snolfers and Golfers from the start. (Snolf = the character themself, Snolfers = everyone else if Everybody's Snolf is enabled, Golfers = Kirby with the Golf copy ability)

Think more about how things should be split between ThinkFrame, PreThinkFrame, PostThinkFrame, PlayerThink, MobjThinker and possibly other hooks.

The shot guide is unreliable and things like goop interfere with it.
