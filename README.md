## Snolf Robo Blast 2

Snolf character mod for Sonic Robo Blast 2 that allows you to play it like golf. Snolf cannot move normally and controls like a golf game. Aim with the camera and use the jump button to start charging a shot. Use the jump button again to time your shot power.

Not all levels may be completable.
